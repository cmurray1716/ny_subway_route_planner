# ny_subway_route_planner
A python script to plan a route from one New York subway station to another using Neo4j.

The dataset chosen for this route planner was the New York Subway system. The data is retrieved from the data.ny.gov API. The main route planner will allow you to input a starting station and target station, and return a list of steps in order to get to your destination.

To run the scripts in this repository and access the API you will need to install the python package - sodapy. The API also requires authentication. You can create your own account to get an access token.

This project was completed on Windows 11 with Python 3.11.5.
